# R6-VOD-Analysis-with-OpenCV
This repo is outdated, working on a conversion using memory maps. The new anticheat has some form of dynamically changing the dynamic memory maps and is easier said then done.

Run the main.py in the folder with your VOD to be analysed and label it "VOD.mp4".

File is outputed to success.xls after completion.
